## Reporting a Vulnerability

To contact our security team, you must follow the following steps:

**1: Vulnerability Identification:** <br/>
First, clearly identify the vulnerability you want to report. This may include specific details about the affected software or system, the nature of the vulnerability (e.g. SQL injection, cross-site scripting), and any other relevant information that could assist in the initial assessment.<br/><br/>
**2: Start of a Discussion:**
Then, create a new discussion in the project repository, presenting your information completely, demonstrating all your identified points of improvement/vulnerability.<br/><br/>
**3: Updates:** <br/>
Depending on the complexity of the reported vulnerability, you can expect regular updates on the progress of the investigation. These updates will be provided via email or through our dedicated communications portal.<br/><br/>
**4: Final Decision:** <br/>
Once the analysis is complete, our team will make a decision on whether to accept or reject the vulnerability. If the vulnerability is accepted, you will be informed about next steps, including the release of a patch or workaround. Otherwise, if the vulnerability is rejected, you will receive a detailed explanation of the reasons for that decision.<br/><br/>
**5: Additional Contact:** <br/>
For additional questions or clarifications, feel free to contact us via the project owner's GitHub and your contact networks.<br/><br/>
Remember, your collaboration is crucial to improving the security of our systems and services. We are required to follow these guidelines when reporting vulnerabilities to ensure an effective and timely response.
