| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| build     | Commits related to tweaks or improvements to the build system, such as Webpack configurations, build scripts, and other aspects of the build infrastructure.                                                                                                                                                         |
| chore     | Commits that involve general code maintenance tasks, but are not directly related to specific features or bug fixes. This may include dependency updates, file reorganization, code formatting, repository organization improvements, and other administrative tasks. |
| ci        | Commits related to continuous integration (CI) configurations or scripts, such as tweaks to Travis CI configurations, GitHub Actions, or other CI/CD tools. These commits are important to ensure that automated testing and deployment work correctly.                                               |
| docs      | Commits involving project documentation. This may include updates to README files, code comments, adding or improving source code documentation, automatically generating documentation, and other documentation-related activities that make the project more accessible and understandable.                 |
| feat      | Commits that introduce new functionality into the source code. This includes adding entirely new features that improve the application's behavior or capability.                                                                                                                                                         |
| fix       | Commits that fix a bug or problem in existing code. "Fix" commits are used to resolve identified issues, making the application more stable and functional.                                                                                                                                                       |
| perf      | Commits that aim to optimize the performance of existing code, without adding new features. This could include performance improvements in algorithms, reducing resource consumption, or speeding up critical operations.                                                                                                               |
| refactor  | Commits that involve code refactoring, that is, changes to the code that do not add or remove functionality, but improve the structure, clarity or efficiency of the code. Refactoring is important to keep the code clean and easy to understand.                                                                        |
| revert    | Commits that revert previous changes. They are used to undo one or more previous commits that introduced problems or unwanted behavior.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| style     | Commits related to improvements in code formatting, such as spacing adjustments, code formatting and other visual aspects. This helps maintain a consistent and readable code style.                                                                                                                                 |
| test      | Test-related commits, such as adding new tests, fixing existing tests, or improving the testing infrastructure. Rigorous testing is essential to ensure code works correctly and to avoid regressions.                                                                                       |
